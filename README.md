# ShrimpEncoding
This project explores different ways to encode text using shrimps.
The idea originated from me and some friends using the shrimp emoji ü¶ê to respond to anything.
Then I tought it would be fun to actually be able to write something using ü¶ê.
The result is what you see here.
You can try it out on [the shrimp site](https://shrimp.lynaris.de)
